# Action Recognition Deep Learning

This repository contains some files that were taken originally from: https://github.com/bryanyzhu/two-stream-pytorch.

The main contribution focuses on the creation of a new stream (convolutional neural network) that is trained with images of visual rhythm generated from the videos of databases UCF101 and HMDB51.
